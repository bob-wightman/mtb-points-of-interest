### General points

Follow the existing layout of the information presented. I.e. just Opening hours, phone and website details. See categories.md for more details about what is needed for specific categories.

Use the same icons as for existing categories.

Do not add review like comments such as "Great service", "Unhelpful staff" or "Discount available to members of XXX cycling club", keep the data to a basic "neutral" set.
